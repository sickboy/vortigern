My love for computing began in the nineties, initially playing games on an Amiga 500, an Amstrad 8086, Acer 8088, 486DX, the first Pentium and so forth.
As time moved on I became more and more attracted to the technical side of things
and developed an intense affection for everything related to IT.
In the meantime I have over fifteen years of IT experience and over ten years in all things related to software development.

Through the years I've grown from building systems to managing software and networks.
To then embark on a journey of software development starting with modding computer games, to writing desktop and server apps, 
and then websites and apps.

I love using cutting edge technology.
Remaining flexible and open minded is key to me and I pride myself in adopting many different technologies and paradigms.
Constantly learning new things and evolving the way I work. Always trying to find the right tool for the job.

Now onto the leisure part..

*I'm a big fan of the Italian coffee arts, like this nice looking (and tasting!) Cappuccino.

I'm also doing various aerobic sports and enjoy well written movies and complex TV series.
I'm still interested in the latest developments of computer games and still play them on occasion.
